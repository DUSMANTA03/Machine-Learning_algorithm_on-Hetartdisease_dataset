# Machine-Learning_algorithm_on-Hetartdisease_dataset
# We have used python libraries:


1.   NumPy: It is a Python library used for working with arrays.
2.   Pandas: It is a Python library,used to analyze data.
3. Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python
4.   Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib.
5.  LogisticRegression: It is used forprediction and classification problems.


## We have used heart disease dataset. we are classifying the peoples wheather they have heart disease or not according to features in this dataset.
**We are applying ML algorithms like :**
*   KNN algorithm
*   DECISION TREE algorithm
*   Logistic REGRESSION[a statistical analysis method to predict a binary outcome, such as yes or no.]
*   RANDOM FOREST algorithm
*   Naive Bayes algorithm
*   Support vector machine (SVM)
